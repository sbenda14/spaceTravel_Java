## Version 1: Nearest Neighbor solution to TSP.

This project attempts to solve the traveling salesperson problem in space. Given a set of X,Y,Z coordinates, 
the nearest neighbor algorithm is used to find the 'shortest' path through space. On average, this algorithm should 
be within ~25% of exact solution...

## Assumptions of input file
* it is a .txt file
* each line is a new XYZ coordinate
* the first line of the file is the desired starting point coordinate
* coordinates are formatted as:
 ``` 
    GPS:wayptName:X:Y:Z:#color 
 ```
